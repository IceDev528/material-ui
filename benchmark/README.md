# Browser benchmark

This project is used when running the following command:

```sh
yarn benchmark
```

It is suppose to give developers comparable values between running different scenarios inside the browser, that can be find the `./scenarios` folder.

You should use these numbers exclusively for comparing performance between different scenarios, not as absolute values. There is also a `./noop` scenario, that renders nothing, to give you the idea of the initial setup time before the actual code is being run.
