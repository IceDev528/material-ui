## The idea behind the example

The project uses [Preact](https://github.com/developit/preact), which is a fast 3kB alternative to React with the same modern API.

This example uses CRA with `react-app-rewired` for adding webpack aliases for preact.

It includes `@mui/material` and its peer dependencies, including `emotion`, the default style engine in MUI v5.

If you prefer, you can [use styled-components instead](https://mui.com/guides/interoperability/#styled-components).

## What's next?

<!-- #default-branch-switch -->

You now have a working example project.
You can head back to the documentation, continuing browsing it from the [templates](https://mui.com/getting-started/templates/) section.
