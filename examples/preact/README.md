# Preact example

## How to use

Download the example [or clone the repo](https://github.com/mui/material-ui):

<!-- #default-branch-switch -->

```sh
curl https://codeload.github.com/mui/material-ui/tar.gz/master | tar -xz --strip=2  material-ui-master/examples/preact
cd preact
```

Install it and run:

```sh
npm install
npm run start
```

## The idea behind the example

The project uses [Preact](https://github.com/developit/preact), which is a fast 3kB alternative to React with the same modern API.

This example uses CRA with `react-app-rewired` for adding webpack aliases for preact.

It includes `@mui/material` and its peer dependencies, including `emotion`, the default style engine in MUI v5.

If you prefer, you can [use styled-components instead](https://mui.com/material-ui/guides/interoperability/#styled-components).

## What's next?

<!-- #default-branch-switch -->

You now have a working example project.
You can head back to the documentation, continuing browsing it from the [templates](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/templates/) section.
