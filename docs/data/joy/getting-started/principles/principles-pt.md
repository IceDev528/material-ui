# Principles

<p class="description">Learn about the principles that have helped shape Joy.</p>

## Keep it essential

Joy should work with the least amount of effort possible. We're striving for the essential only, both in the component API and design (look & feel). Components should have only what they need to do the job. What is considered essential will be drawn from MUI's experience over the years developing component libraries like this one, as well as from benchmarks of modern API and design guidelinesâ€”especially when it comes to developing web apps.

## Looks great out-of-the-box

Joy needs to be simple yet characteristic. Visual attributes such as scale, size, and density should be consistent across all of the components so they live together nicely. We aim to spark delight with simplicity and attention to detail. You should feel like your UI looks great from the start.

## Encourage creativity

We're aiming for Joy to be entirely customizable, and seen as a great starting point. This is meant to encourage you to extend, change, and revamp how Joy looks. Be creative by making it your own.

## Focus on developer experience

A great developer experience is not only the quality of the code we ship but also how clear the documentation is, and what learning resources are available for developers. We hope that bundling it all together brings joy.
