# Portal

<p class="description">The Portal component lets you render its children into a DOM node that exists outside of the Portal's own DOM hierarchy.</p>

## This document has moved

:::warning
Please refer to the [Portal](/base/react-portal/) component page in the MUI Base docs for demos and details on usage.

Portal is a part of the standalone [MUI Base](/base/getting-started/overview/) component library.
It is currently re-exported from `@mui/material` for your convenience, but it will be removed from this package in a future major version, after `@mui/base` gets a stable release.
