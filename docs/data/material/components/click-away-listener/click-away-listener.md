# Click-Away Listener

<p class="description">The Click-Away Listener component detects when a click event happens outside of its child element.</p>

## MUI Base

:::info
Click-Away Listener is a part of the standalone [MUI Base](/base/getting-started/overview/) component library.
It is currently re-exported from `@mui/material` for your convenience, but it will be removed from this package in a future major version, after `@mui/base` gets a stable release.

Please refer to the [Click-Away Listener](/base/react-click-away-listener/) component page in the MUI Base docs for examples and details on usage.
