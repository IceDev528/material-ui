# No SSR

<p class="description">The No-SSR component defers the rendering of children components from the server to the client.</p>

## MUI Base

:::info
No-SSR is a part of the standalone [MUI Base](/base/getting-started/overview/) component library.
It is currently re-exported from `@mui/material` for your convenience, but it will be removed from this package in a future major version, after `@mui/base` gets a stable release.

Please refer to the [No-SSR](/base/react-no-ssr/) component page in the MUI Base docs for examples and details on usage.
