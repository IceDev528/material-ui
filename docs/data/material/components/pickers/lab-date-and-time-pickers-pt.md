# Date and time pickers

<p class="description">The <code>DatePicker</code>, <code>TimePicker</code>, and related components have been moved to MUI X â€” our collection of advanced components.</p>

## Why have the picker components been moved to MUI X?

MUI X components are built for complex use cases. Date and time pickers are difficult to pull off correctly, so they deserve the special attention that they will receive as part of MUI X.

To learn more, check out the [blog post about the move](/blog/lab-date-pickers-to-mui-x/).

## How do I migrate?

Follow the [migration page](/x/react-date-pickers/migration-lab/) to migrate from lab to MUI X.

## Where is the new documentation?

You can find documentation on the date and time picker components in the [MUI X docs](/x/react-date-pickers/getting-started/).

## Where should I report issues, request features, or submit PRs?

Please share all feedback, issues, and requests in the [MUI X repository](https://github.com/mui/mui-x).
