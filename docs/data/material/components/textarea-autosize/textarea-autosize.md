# Textarea Autosize

<p class="description">The Textarea Autosize component gives you a textarea HTML element that automatically adjusts its height to match the length of the content within.</p>

## MUI Base

:::info
Textarea Autosize is a part of the standalone [MUI Base](/base/getting-started/overview/) component library.
It is currently re-exported from `@mui/material` for your convenience, but it will be removed from this package in a future major version, after `@mui/base` gets a stable release.

Please refer to the [Textarea Autosize](/base/react-textarea-autosize/) component page in the MUI Base docs for examples and details on usage.
