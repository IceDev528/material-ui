# Tabs

<p class="description">Tabs make it easy to explore and switch between different views.</p>

Tabs organize and allow navigation between groups of content that are related and at the same level of hierarchy.

{{"component": "modules/components/ComponentLinkHeader.js", "design": false}}

## Basic tabs

Tabs are implemented using a handful of components, each with a specific purpose:

- TabUnstyled - an actual tab. Clicking on it displays the associated content.
- TabsListUnstyled - container for tabs. Responsible for handling focus and keyboard navigation between tabs.
- TabPanelUnstyled - hosts the content associated with a tab.
- TabsUnstyled - top-level component wrapping TabsListUnstyled and TabPanelUnstyled and letting them communicate.

```js
import TabsUnstyled from '@mui/base/TabsUnstyled';
import TabsListUnstyled from '@mui/base/TabUnstyled';
import TabUnstyled from '@mui/base/TabUnstyled';
import TabPanelUnstyled from '@mui/base/TabPanelUnstyled';
```

You can associate a tab with tab panel using the `value` prop.
If a tab with a given `value` is selected, a tab panel with a matching `value` will be shown.

Note that setting a `value` on a `TabUnstyled` is not mandatory.
If you omit this prop, it will default to order of a tab within its parent TabsListUnstyled.
This order is 0-based (the first tab has its `value` set to `0`, the next one `1`, etc.).

## Customizing the root element

By default, the `TabUnstyled` renders a native `button` element.
You are free to override this by setting the `component` or `components.Root` prop.
If a non-interactive element (such as a span) is provided this way, the `TabUnstyled` will take care of adding accessibility attributes.

The `TabPanelUnstyled`, on the other hand, renders a native `div` element by default.
You are free to override this as well by setting the `component` or `components.Root` prop on the `TabPanelUnstyled`.

## Third-party routing library

One frequent use case is to perform navigation on the client only, without an HTTP round-trip to the server.
The `Tab` component provides the `component` prop to handle this use case.
Here is a [more detailed guide](/guides/routing/#tabs).

## Accessibility

(WAI-ARIA: https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#tabpanel)

The following steps are needed in order to provide necessary information for assistive technologies:

1. Label `TabsUnstyled` via `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`.
2. `TabUnstyled`s need to be connected to their corresponding tab panels by setting the correct `id`, `aria-controls` and `aria-labelledby`.

An example for the current implementation can be found in the demos on this page.

### Keyboard navigation

The components implement keyboard navigation using the "manual activation" behavior.
If you want to switch to the "selection automatically follows focus" behavior you have pass `selectionFollowsFocus` to the `Tabs` component.
The WAI-ARIA authoring practices have a detailed guide on [how to decide when to make selection automatically follow focus](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#kbd_selection_follows_focus).

#### Demo

The following two demos only differ in their keyboard navigation behavior.
Focus a tab and navigate with arrow keys to notice the difference, e.g. <kbd class="key">Arrow Right</kbd>.

```jsx
/* Tabs where selection follows focus */
<TabsUnstyled selectionFollowsFocus />
```
