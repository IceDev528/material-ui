# Selection Controls

Progress and activity indicators are visual indications of an app loading content.

A single visual indicator should be used to represent each type of operation. For example, a refresh operation should display either a refresh bar or an activity circle, but not both.

**Determinate** indicators display how long an operation will take.

**Indeterminate** indicators visualize an unspecified wait time.
