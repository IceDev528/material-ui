# Button

Buttons communicate the action that will occur when the user touches them.

Material buttons trigger an ink reaction on press. They may display text, imagery, or both. Flat buttons and raised buttons are the most commonly used types.

## Flat Buttons

Flat buttons are text-only buttons. They may be used in dialogs, toolbars, or inline. They do not lift, but fill with color on press.
