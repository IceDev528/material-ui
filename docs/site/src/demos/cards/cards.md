# Cards

A card is a sheet of material that serves as an entry point to more detailed information.

Cards display content composed of different elements whose size or supported actions vary.

Cards are a convenient means of displaying content composed of different elements. Theyâ€™re also well-suited for showcasing elements whose size or supported actions vary, like photos with captions of variable length.

## Simple Card

Although cards can support multiple actions, UI controls, and an overflow menu, use restraint and remember that cards are entry points to more complex and detailed information.

## UI Controls

Supplemental actions within the card are explicitly called out using icons, text, and UI controls, typically placed at the bottom of the card.
