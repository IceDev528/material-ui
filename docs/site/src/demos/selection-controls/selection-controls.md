# Selection Controls

[Selection controls](https://material.google.com/components/selection-controls.html) allow the user to select options.

Three types of selection controls are covered in this guidance:

- **Checkboxes** allow the selection of multiple options from a set.
- **Radio buttons** allow the selection of a single option from a set.
- **Switches** allow a selection to be turned on or off.

## Checkboxes

Checkboxes allow the user to select multiple options from a set.

If you have multiple options appearing in a list, you can preserve space by using checkboxes instead of on/off switches.

If you have a single option, avoid using a checkbox and use an on/off switch instead.
