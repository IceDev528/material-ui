# Text fields

Text fields allow users to input text and usually appear in forms. Users may enter text, numbers, or mixed-format types of input.

## Basic text field

Basic text fields implement the functionality of a regular `<input>` and automatically scroll their content to the left as the text input cursor reaches the right edge of the input field.

In its simplist form, the `<TextField>` component is a complete form control including a label, underline and help text.
