# Text fields

[Text fields](https://material.google.com/components/text-fields.html) allow users to input text and usually appear in forms. Users may enter text, numbers, or mixed-format types of input.

## Complete text field

The `<TextField>` wrapper component is a complete form control including an label, underline and help text.
This component is made up of the smaller text field parts that you can also leverage yourself to significantly customize your input.
