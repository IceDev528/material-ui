# Typography

Too many type sizes and styles at once can wreck any layout.
A [typographic scale](https://material.google.com/style/typography.html#typography-styles) has a limited set of type sizes that work well together along with the layout grid.

## General

The *Roboto* font will be not automatically loaded by Material-UI.
The developer is responsible for loading all fonts used in their application.
Shown below is a sample link markup used to load the Roboto font from a CDN.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500">
```
