# Icons

Material [icons](https://material.io/guidelines/style/icons.html) use geometric shapes to visually represent core ideas, capabilities, or topics.

## SVG Icons

The `SvgIcon` component takes an SVG `path` element as its child, and converts it to a React component which displays
the path and allows the icon to be styled and respond to mouse events.

The resulting icon can be used as is, or included as a child for other Material-UI components that use icons.
