# Installation

Material-UI is available as an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.org/package/material-ui).

To install and save in your `package.json` dependencies, run:

```
npm i -S material-ui
```

## Roboto Font

Material-UI was designed with the [Roboto](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto)
font in mind, so be sure to include it in your project.

Here are [some instructions](http://www.google.com/fonts#UsePlace:use/Collection:Roboto:400,300,500)
on how to do so. You can also refer to our [typography page](/#/style/typography) for more details.

## Icon Font

In order to use the font `Icon` component, or to use icon names (ligatures) directly in components
that support them, you must first the add the [Material icons](https://material.io/icons/) font. 
Here are [some instructions](http://google.github.io/material-design-icons/#icon-font-for-the-web) 
on how to do so.

## SVG Icons

In order to use prebuilt SVG Material icons, such as those found in the [component demos](/#/component-demos) 
you must first install the [material-ui-icons](https://www.npmjs.org/package/material-ui) package:

```
npm i -S material-ui-icons
```

This package replaces the `svg-icons` previously included with Material-UI.
