## Time Picker

Time pickers let user select a single time (in the hours:minutes format).
The selected time is indicated by the filled circle at the end of the clock hand.

<Ad />

#### Basic usage

A time picker should adjust to a userâ€™s preferred time setting, i.e. the 12-hour or 24-hour format.

<Example source={BasicTimePicker} />

#### Responsiveness

<Example source={InlineTimePicker} />

#### Advanced keyboard input

<Example source={KeyboardTimePicker} />

#### Static mode

It is possible to render any picker inline. This will be really helpful to build custom popover/modal containers.
For that use `variant="static"`.

<Hidden smDown>
  <Example paddingBottom source={StaticTimePicker} />
</Hidden>

#### Seconds

Seconds input can be used for selection of a precise time point.

<Example source={SecondsTimePicker} />

#### Components API

<LinkedComponents components={['TimePicker', 'KeyboardTimePicker']} />
