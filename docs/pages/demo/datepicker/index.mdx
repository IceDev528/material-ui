## Date picker

Date pickers use a dialog window or an inline popover to select a single date.
The selected day is indicated by a filled circle. The current day is indicated by a different
color and type weight.

#### Basic usage

<Example testId="datepicker-example" source={BasicDatePicker} />

#### Keyboard Input

It is recommended to use keyboard input with mask for a better desktop experience. Make sure that mask will be automatically
generated from passed `format`. It's recommended to use only robust formats for keyboard input.

> Make sure that `onChange` have second parameter here. So if you will not do `onChange={date => handleDateChange(date)}` you will get console warning [useState hook dose not accept a second callback argument](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/14174)

<Example source={KeyboardDatePicker} />

#### Different views

It is also allowed to combine `year`, `month` and `date` selection views.
Thus you can easily create
- Year picker
- Month picker
- Month + year picker

<Example source={ViewsDatePicker} />

#### Inline mode

<Example source={InlineDatePicker} />

#### Static mode

It is possible to render any picker inline. This will be really helpful to build custom popover/modal containers.
For that use `variant="static"`.

<Example paddingBottom source={StaticDatePicker} />

#### Customization

The displaying of dates is heavily cusomizable. Thus you can add badges or fully change displaying of day.

<Example source={CustomDay} />

#### Dynamic data

Sometimes it's required to display additional info right in the calendar.
For this just return `Promise` in `onMonthChange`.

<Example source={ServerRequest} />

#### Components API

<LinkedComponents components={['DatePicker', 'KeyboardDatePicker']} />
