## Date picker

[Date pickers](https://material.io/components/pickers/) let users select a date, or a range of dates. They should be suitable for the context in which they appear.

#### Basic usage

Will be rendered to modal dialog on mobile and textfield with popover on desktop.

<Example testId="datepicker-example" source={BasicDatePicker} />

#### Responsiveness

Date/Time pickers experience is extremely different on mobile and desktop. Here is how components will look on different devices.
The default `Datepicker` component is responsive, which means that `Mobile` or `Desktop` mode will be rendered according to device viewport.

<Example source={DatePickers} />

#### Different views

It is also allowed to combine `year`, `month` and `date` selection views.
Thus you can easily create

- Year picker
- Month picker
- Month + year picker

<Example source={ViewsDatePicker} />

#### Static mode

It is possible to render any picker without modal or popover. This can be really helpful to build custom popover/modal containers.
For that use `StaticDatePicker`.

<Hidden smDown>
  <Example paddingBottom source={StaticDatePicker} />
</Hidden>

#### Advanced keyboard input

We are providing default localized formats, but you can change this behaviour with `format` and `mask` props.

<Example source={AdvancedKeyboard} />

#### Customization

The displaying of dates is heavily cusomizable. Thus you can add badges or fully change displaying of day.

<Example source={CustomDay} />

#### Dynamic data

Sometimes it's required to display additional info right in the calendar.
For this just return `Promise` in `onMonthChange`.

<Example source={ServerRequest} />

#### Components API

<LinkedComponents components={['DatePicker', 'KeyboardDatePicker']} />
