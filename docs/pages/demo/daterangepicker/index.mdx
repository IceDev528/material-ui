## Date picker

[Date pickers](https://material.io/components/pickers/) let users select a date, or a range of dates. They should be suitable for the context in which they appear.

#### Basic usage

Basic DateRangePicker example, make sure that you can pass almost any prop of [DatePicker]('/api/DatePicker')

<Example source={BasicDateRangePicker} />

#### Responsiveness

Date/Time pickers experience is extremely different on mobile and desktop. Here is how components will look on different devices.
The default `DateRangePicker` component is responsive, which means that `Mobile` or `Desktop` mode will be rendered according to device viewport.

<Example source={ResponsiveDateRangePicker} />

#### Different amount of calendars

Make sure that `calendars` prop is working only for desktop mode.

<Example source={CalendarsDateRangePicker} />

#### Disabling dates

Disabling dates performs just like in simple `DatePicker`

<Example source={MinMaxDateRangePicker} />

#### Static mode

It is possible to render any picker without modal or popper. For that use `StaticDateRangePicker`.

<Hidden smDown>
  <Example paddingBottom source={StaticDateRangePicker} />
</Hidden>
