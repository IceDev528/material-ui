This component combines date & time pickers. It allows to select both date and time with the same control.

**Note:** This component is not listed in [material design guidelines](https://material.io/components/)

#### Basic usage

Allows choosing date then time. There are too many views, so tabs are required to visually distinguish date/time steps.

<Example source={BasicDateTimePicker} />

#### Responsiveness

DateTimePicker is a complex control, so you may consider using `MobileDateTimePicker` for desktop users as well.

<Example source={DateTimePickers} />

#### Date & Time validation

It is possible to restrict date and time selection in couple of different ways. If you need to restrict time selection
you could use `minDateTime` to restrict selecting date and time before particular moment of time.
Or you can use `minTime` to disable a part of time in each day.

#### Customization

Here are some examples of heavily customized date & time pickers
