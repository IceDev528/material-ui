#### Basic usage

Allows choosing date then time. There are too many views, so tabs are required to visually distinguish date/time steps.

<Example source={BasicDateTimePicker} />

#### Responsiveness

DateTimePicker is a complex control, so you may consider using `MobileDateTimePicker` for desktop users as well.

<Example source={DateTimePickers} />

#### Customization

Here are some examples of heavily customized date & time pickers

<Example source={CustomDateTimePicker} />
