## Static components

In some places it's required to use some internal control for the calendar or some time input. Here you
are! You can use any sub-control of the pickers directly.

<Ad />

Also you can use our own HOC that is used for any picker which provides managing temporary
chosen date and submitting state logic.

**Warning:** Make sure, that *all* your imports are consistent (or default or named) and **are not mixed**

#### Static components example

* `inputProps` - props to manage date input state, format and validation.
* `wrapperProps` - props to manage accept, dismiss, clear and any modal/inline functionality.
