Somewhere its required to use some internal control for calendar or some timeinput. Here you
are! You can use directly any sub-control of the pickers.

Also you can use our own HOC that is using for any picker which provide managing temporary
chosen date and submitting state logic.

**Warning:** Make sure, that *all* your imports are consistent (or default or named) and **do not mixed**

#### Static components example

* `wrapperProps` - props to manage accept, dismiss, clear and any modal/inline functionality.
