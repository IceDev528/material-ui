## Static components

Somewhere its required to use some internal control for calendar or some timeinput. Here you
are! You can use directly any sub-control of the pickers. Please note - if you want to use
internal controls **ALL** your imports must be from the relative paths

Also you can use our own HOC that is using for any picker which provide managing temporary
chosen date and submitting state logic.

#### Static components example
Please make sure that your imports are consistent
