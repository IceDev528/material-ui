## Override styles

The default pickers appearance is built based on material-ui's theme provided. So pickers will take all
colors/fonts/theme settings as any other material-ui component.

#### Default theme

You can customize the material-ui theme, that is passed to `ThemeProvider` and the pickers will leverage your settings.

<Example source={CssTheme} />

#### Override example

*Date/Time pickers are quite simple controls from UX perspective, so most people just use the default appearence*

That's why we are not providing any for-component classes api to override stylesheets for any particular
component. The only way to override existing stylesheets are with the use of global material-ui theme
overrides.


<Example source={CssOverrides} />


#### Typescript
For TypeScript users it's also required to extend default material-ui theme typings with pickers controls.
(This will also autocomplete classnames)

```typescript
import { Overrides } from "@material-ui/core/styles/overrides";
import { MuiPickersOverrides } from 'material-ui-pickers/typings/overrides'

type overridesNameToClassKey = { [P in keyof MuiPickersOverrides]: keyof
MuiPickersOverrides[P] }

declare module "@material-ui/core/styles/overrides" {
    export interface ComponentNameToClassKey extends overridesNameToClassKey { }
}
```
