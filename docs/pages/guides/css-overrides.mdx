## Override styles

Default pickers appearance built based on material-ui theme provided. So pickers will take all
colors/fonts/theme setting as any other material-ui component.

#### Default theme

You can customize material-ui theme, that passed to `ThemeProvider` and picker`s will leverage your settings.

<Example source={CssTheme} />

#### Override example

*Date/Time pickers are quite simple control from UX side, so most people just use default appearence*

Thats why we are not providing any for-component classes api to override stylesheet for particular
component. Only one way to override existed stylesheet - usage of global material-ui theme
overrides.


<Example source={CssOverrides} />


#### Typescript
For typescript users it's also required to extend default material-ui theme typings with pickers controls.
(This will also autocomplete classnames)

```typescript
declare module '@material-ui/core/styles/overrides' {
  import { MuiPickersOverrides } from 'material-ui-pickers/typings/overrides'

  export interface Overrides extends MuiPickersOverrides { }
}
```
