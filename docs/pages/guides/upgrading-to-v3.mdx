## Upgrading to v3

Version `v3` for @material-ui/pickers coming with whole bunch of breaking changes. This is a guide of how-to update :)
<Ad />

#### ‚¨áÔ∏è Install
First of all you need to install new package, because the project is transfered to mui-org

```
npm i @material-ui/pickers @material-ui/core@next @material-ui/styles

yarn add @material-ui/pickers @material-ui/core@next @material-ui/styles
```

**Note**: it's required also to update your `@material-ui/core` version to `@next`


#### üåö Imports
There are a lot of changes in imports. From now on we are not providing `keyboard` prop on the pickers.
Keyboard mode comes with separate components like `<KeyboardDatePicker />`.
Thus you will be sure that keyboard-specific logic will be correctly tree-shaked.

```diff
- import { DatePicker } from '@material-ui/pickers'
+ import { KeyboardDatePicker } from '@material-ui/pickers'

- <DatePicker keyboard />
+ <KeyboardDatePicker />
```

Also there are no more wrapper-specific components, like `InlineDatePicker`. Use `variant` prop instead.

```diff
- import { InlineDatePicker } from '@material-ui/pickers'
+ import { DatePicker } from '@material-ui/pickers'

- <InlineDatePicker />
+ <DatePicker variant="inline" />
```

#### üí™ State management

We done a lot of work to make state-management of pickers more obviuos in `v3` and simplify form integration experience.
From now there is *no hidden internal state* under the hood. Your components are truly controlled.

That means that now `onChange` will be called on **each** particular day-click or keystroke.
So if you are doing some heavy operations in `onChange` (e.g. xhr requests, dom mutations or redirects) -
please move them to the `onAccept`. This callback will be fired only when user actually accepts the date.

```diff
<DatePicker
+ onChange={setDate} // stateLogic
+ onAccept={requestSomeDataFromServer} // async action
- onChange={(newDate) => {
-   setDate(newDate)
-   requestSomeDataFromServer(newDate)
- }}
/>
```

#### ‚å® Keyboard mode

Previously keyboard mode was a bit painful, especially from form integration prospective.
That's why we recreated it from scratch.
Now `onChange` prop for `<Keyboard(Date|Time)Picker />` has different signature from the pure pickers:

```ts
type KeybordOnChange = (date: MaterialUiPickersDate | null, value: string | undefined) => void;
```

It is even possible to control keyboard pickers by pure string. ‚ö†Ô∏è `value` prop will work as well ‚ö†Ô∏è

```jsx
function KeyboardString() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState('01/01/2019')

  return (
    <KeyboardDatePicker
      format="MM/dd/yyyy"
      inputValue={value}
      onChange={(_, newValue) => setValue(newValue)}
    />
  )
}
```

Also we completely replaced [react-text-mask](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-text-mask) with [rifm](https://github.com/istarkov/rifm).
That saved us several kbs of bundlesize, improved performance

##### üéâ And now no more need in mask prop üéâ

Mask will be generated and applied automatically from the `format` passed.
So please, make sure that your formats are easy to input from keyboard.
And it is still possible to fully customize mask, checkout [this](/api/timepicker#keyboard-input) example.


```diff
<KeyboardDatePicker
  format="dd/MM/yyyy"
- mask={[/\d/, /\d/, "/", /\d/, /\d/, "/", /\d/, /\d/, /\d/, /\d/]}
/>
```

#### üö™ Controlling open/close state

`ref` approach to customize open/close state was replaced with `open` props and `onClose`, `onOpen` callbacks.
Check out [new example](/guides/controlling-programmatically)

#### üõ° Typescript

We are working hard to make this library perfectly works with Typescript.
And from v3 date type in such props like `onChange`, `value` will automatically be inferred from the `@date-io` package you used.
So less `any` from our side :)

#### üôà Misc
- Improved accessibility by making toolbar button actually focusable `<button />`
- Remove `withUtils` hoc, and provide `useUtils` hoc
- Remove `BasePicker` hoc, and provide `usePickerState` and `useKeyboardPickerState` hooks
- Remove `openToYearSelection` prop in favor of `openTo`
- Remove exported `MuiPickersContextConsumer` in favor of `useUtils` hook
- When using `views` prop - DatePicker by default will open to the the **first** item of `views`.
And order of views will follow order in the passed `views` array.
