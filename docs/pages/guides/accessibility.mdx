## Accessibility

<Ad />

Pickers accessibility is highly impoertant, because this control is becoming completely unusable if there is
no appropriate focus managment.

The dialog contains a calendar that uses the [grid](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#grid) pattern to present buttons that enable the user to choose a day from the calendar.
Choosing a date from the calendar closes the dialog and populates the date input field. When the dialog is opened,
if the input field is empty, or does not contain a valid date, then the current date is focused in the calendar.
Otherwise, the focus is placed on the day in the calendar that matches the value of the date input field.
It is possible to navigate throught the calendar, year selection and clock with only keyboard.

But still there are some limitations:

- You need to provide accessible placeholder (`mm/dd/yyyy`) according to used format and locale
- Masked input is not really well announcing via screen readers, so you may consider disable it

### Example

Here is working accessible example, compare it to the [wia-aria datepicker dialog example](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/dialog-modal/datepicker-dialog.html)
