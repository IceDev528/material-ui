## Time Picker

Time pickers use a dialog to select a single time (in the hours:minutes format).
The selected time is indicated by the filled circle at the end of the clock hand.

#### Basic usage
A time picker should adjusts to a userâ€™s preferred time setting, i.e. the 12-hour or 24-hour format.

#### Inline mode
