## Date picker

Date pickers use a dialog window or an inline popover to select a single date.
The selected day is indicated by a filled circle. The current day is indicated by a different
color and type weight.

#### Basic usage

<Example source={BasicDatePicker} />

#### Keyboard Input

It is recommended to use keyboard input with mask for better desktop experience. More information about [mask](https://github.com/insin/inputmask-core#pattern)

<Example source={KeyboardDatePicker} />

#### Different views

It is also allowed to combine `year`, `month` and `date` selection views.
Thus you can easily create
- Year picker
- Month picker
- Month + year picker

<Example source={ViewsDatePicker} />

#### Inline mode

<Example source={InlineDatePicker} />

#### Customization

It is allowed to hardly customize displaying of dates. Thus you can add badges or fully change displaying of day.

<Example source={CustomDay} />

<PropTypesTable src="DatePicker/DatePickerModal.tsx" />
