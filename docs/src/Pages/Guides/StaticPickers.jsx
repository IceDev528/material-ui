      Somewhere its required to use some internal control for calendar or some timeinput. Here you
      are! You can use directly any sub-control of the pickers. Please note - if you want to use
      internal controls ALL your imports must be from the relative paths
    </Typography>

      Also you can use our own HOC that is using for any picker which provide managing temporary
      chosen date and submitting state logic.
