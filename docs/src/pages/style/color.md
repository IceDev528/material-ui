# Color

[Color](https://material.io/guidelines/style/color.html) in material design is inspired by bold hues juxtaposed with muted environments, deep shadows, and bright highlights.

## Color palette

### Important Terms


#### "Palette"

A palette is a collection of colors, i.e. hues and their shades. Material-UI provides all colors from the Material Design guidelines.

#### "Hue" & "Shade"

A single color within the palette is made up of a hue such as "red", and shade, such as "500". 
"red 50" is the lightest shade of red (*pink!*), while "red 900" is the darkest. 
In addition, most hues come with "accent" shades, prefixed wih `A`.

### Examples

The Material Design color palette comprises primary and accent colors that can be used for illustration or to develop your brand colors.
Theyâ€™ve been designed to work harmoniously with each other.

For instance, you can refer to complementary primary and accent colors (for example 'red 500' & 'purple A200'), like so:

```js
import { red, purple } from 'material-ui/colors';

const primary = red[500]; // #F44336
const accent = purple['A200']; // #E040FB
const accent2 = purple.A200; // #E040FB (alternative method)
```
