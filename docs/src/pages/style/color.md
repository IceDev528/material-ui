#### Palette

A palette is a collection of hues. By default, Material-UI ships with all palettes from the material design spec built in. Valid palettes include:

### Examples

This color palette comprises primary and accent colors that can be used for illustration or to develop your brand colors.
Theyâ€™ve been designed to work harmoniously with each other.

For instance, you can use the red color like so:
```js
import { red, purple } from 'material-ui/styles/colors';

const primary = red[500]; // #F44336
const accent = purple['A200']; // #E040FB
```

## Color system

In Material Design, a **primary color** refers to a color that appears most frequently in your app. A **secondary color** refers to a color used to accent key parts of your UI.

Using colors from the Material Design palette is optional.
