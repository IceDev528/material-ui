# Color

[Color](https://material.io/guidelines/style/color.html) in material design is inspired by bold hues juxtaposed with muted environments, deep shadows, and bright highlights.

## Color palette

This color palette comprises primary and accent colors that can be used for illustration or to develop your brand colors.
Theyâ€™ve been designed to work harmoniously with each other.

For instance, you can use the red color like so:
```js
import { red, purple } from 'material-ui/styles/colors';

const primary = red[500]; // #F44336
const accent = purple['A200']; // #E040FB
```
