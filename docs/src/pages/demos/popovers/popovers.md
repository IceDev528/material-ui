# Popovers

A `Popover` can be used to display some content on top of another.

## Anchor playground

Use the radio buttons to adjust the `anchorOrigin` and `transformOrigin` positions.

## Mouse over interaction

We demonstrate who to use the `Popover` component as well as the [react-popper](https://github.com/souporserious/react-popper) package to implement a popover behavior based on the mouse over event.
