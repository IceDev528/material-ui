# Bottom Navigation

[Bottom navigation](https://material.google.com/components/bottom-navigation.html) bars make it easy to explore and switch between top-level views in a single tap.

## Bottom Navigation
When there are only **three** actions, display both icons and text labels at all times.

If there are **four** or **five** actions, display inactive views as icons only.
