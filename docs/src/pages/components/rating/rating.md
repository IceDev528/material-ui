## Hover feedback

You can display a label on hover to help users pick the correct rating value.
The demo uses the `onChangeActive` prop.

## Half ratings

The rating can display any float number with the `value` prop.
Use the `precision` prop to define the minimum increment value change allowed.

## Accessibility

(WAI tutorial: https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/custom-controls/#a-star-rating)

The accessibility of this component relies on:

- A radio group is used with its fields visually hidden.
  It contains six radio buttons, one for each star and another for 0 stars, which is checked by default. Make sure you are providing a `name` prop that is unique to the parent form.
- The labels for the radio buttons contain actual text (“1 Star”, “2 Stars”, …), make sure you provide a `getLabelText` prop when the page language is not English.
