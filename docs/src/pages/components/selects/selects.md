# Select

<p class="description">Select components are used for collecting user provided information from a list of options.</p>

{{"component": "modules/components/ComponentLinkHeader.js"}}

## Basic select

Menus are positioned under their emitting elements, unless they are close to the bottom of the viewport.

{{"demo": "pages/components/selects/BasicSelect.js"}}

## Advanced features

The Select component is meant to be interchangeable with a native `<select>` element.

If you are looking for more advanced features, like combobox, multiselect, autocomplete, async or creatable support, head to the [`Autocomplete` component](/components/autocomplete/).
It's meant to be an improved version of the "react-select" and "downshift" packages.

## Props

The Select component is implemented as a custom `<input>` element of the [InputBase](/api/input-base/).
It extends the [text field components](/components/text-fields/) sub-components, either the [OutlinedInput](/api/outlined-input/), [Input](/api/input/), or [FilledInput](/api/filled-input/), depending on the variant selected.
It shares the same styles and many of the same props. Refer to the respective component's API page for details.

### Filled and standard variants

{{"demo": "pages/components/selects/SelectVariants.js"}}

### Labels and helper text

{{"demo": "pages/components/selects/SelectLabels.js"}}

> âš  Note that when using FormControl with the outlined variant of the Select, you need to provide a label in two places: in the InputLabel component and in the `label` prop of the Select component (see the above demo).

### Auto width

{{"demo": "pages/components/selects/SelectAutoWidth.js"}}

### Other props

{{"demo": "pages/components/selects/SelectOtherProps.js"}}

## Native select

As the user experience can be improved on mobile using the native select of the platform,
we allow such pattern.

{{"demo": "pages/components/selects/NativeSelect.js"}}

## TextField

The `TextField` wrapper component is a complete form control including a label, input and help text.
You can find an example with the select mode [in this section](/components/text-fields/#select).

## Customization

Here are some examples of customizing the component.
You can learn more about this in the [overrides documentation page](/customization/how-to-customize/).

The first step is to style the `InputBase` component.
Once it's styled, you can either use it directly as a text field or provide it to the select `input` prop to have a `select` field.
Notice that the `"standard"` variant is easier to customize, since it does not wrap the contents in a `fieldset`/`legend` markup.

{{"demo": "pages/components/selects/CustomizedSelects.js"}}

## Multiple select

The `Select` component can handle multiple selections.
It's enabled with the `multiple` prop.

Like with the single selection, you can pull out the new value by accessing `event.target.value` in the `onChange` callback. It's always an array.

### Default

{{"demo": "pages/components/selects/MultipleSelect.js"}}

### Checkmarks

{{"demo": "pages/components/selects/MultipleSelectCheckmarks.js"}}

### Chip

{{"demo": "pages/components/selects/MultipleSelectChip.js"}}

### Placeholder

{{"demo": "pages/components/selects/MultipleSelectPlaceholder.js"}}

### Native

{{"demo": "pages/components/selects/MultipleSelectNative.js"}}

## Controlling the open state

You can control the open state of the select with the `open` prop. Alternatively, it is also possible to set the initial (uncontrolled) open state of the component with the `defaultOpen` prop.

{{"demo": "pages/components/selects/ControlledOpenSelect.js"}}

## With a dialog

While it's discouraged by the Material Design guidelines, you can use a select inside a dialog.

{{"demo": "pages/components/selects/DialogSelect.js"}}

## Grouping

Display categories with the `ListSubheader` component or the native `<optgroup>` element.

{{"demo": "pages/components/selects/GroupedSelect.js"}}

## Accessibility

To properly label your `Select` input you need an extra element with an `id` that contains a label.
That `id` needs to match the `labelId` of the `Select` e.g.

```jsx
<InputLabel id="label">Age</InputLabel>
<Select labelId="label" id="select" value="20">
  <MenuItem value="10">Ten</MenuItem>
  <MenuItem value="20">Twenty</MenuItem>
</Select>
```

Alternatively a `TextField` with an `id` and `label` creates the proper markup and
ids for you:

```jsx
<TextField id="select" label="Age" value="20" select>
  <MenuItem value="10">Ten</MenuItem>
  <MenuItem value="20">Twenty</MenuItem>
</TextField>
```

For a [native select](#native-select), you should mention a label by giving the value of the `id` attribute of the select element to the `InputLabel`'s `htmlFor` attribute:

```jsx
<InputLabel htmlFor="select">Age</InputLabel>
<NativeSelect id="select">
  <option value="10">Ten</option>
  <option value="20">Twenty</option>
</NativeSelect>
```

## Unstyled

The Select also comes with an unstyled version.
It's ideal for doing heavy customizations and minimizing bundle size.

### Unstyled component

```jsx
import SelectUnstyled from '@mui/base/SelectUnstyled';
```

#### Basic usage

{{"demo": "pages/components/selects/UnstyledSelectSimple.js"}}

The `SelectUnstyled` is a component that accepts generic props.
Due to Typescript limitations, this may cause unexpected behavior when wrapping the component in `forwardRef` (or other higher-order components).
In such cases, the generic argument will be defaulted to `unknown` and type suggestions will be incomplete.
To avoid this, manually cast the resulting component to the correct type (as shown above).

The rest of the demos below will not use `forwardRef` for brevity.

#### Controlled select

The SelectUnstyled can be used as either uncontrolled (as shown in the demo above) or controlled component.

{{"demo": "pages/components/selects/UnstyledSelectControlled.js"}}

#### Usage with object values

The unstyled select may be used with non-string values.

{{"demo": "pages/components/selects/UnstyledSelectObjectValues.js"}}

#### Customizing the selected value appearance

It is possible to customize the selected value display by providing a function to the `renderValue` prop.
The element returned by this function will be rendered inside the select's button.

{{"demo": "pages/components/selects/UnstyledSelectCustomRenderValue.js"}}

#### Customizing the options' appearance

Options don't have to be plain strings.
You can include custom elements to be rendered inside the listbox.

{{"demo": "pages/components/selects/UnstyledSelectRichOptions.js"}}

#### Grouping

Options can be grouped, similarly to the how the native `select` element works.
Unlike the native `select`, however, the groups can be nested.

Place the `Option` components inside `OptionGroup` to achieve this.

{{"demo": "pages/components/selects/UnstyledSelectGrouping.js"}}

#### Multiselect

To be able to select multiple options at once, use the `MultiSelectUnstyled` component.

```js
import { MultiSelectUnstyled } from '@mui/base/SelectUnstyled';
```

{{"demo": "pages/components/selects/UnstyledSelectMultiple.js"}}

### useSelect hook

```js
import { useSelect } from '@mui/base/SelectUnstyled';
```

If you need to use Select's functionality in another component, you can use the `useSelect` hook.
It enables maximal customizability at the cost of being low-level.

The following example shows a select that opens when hovered over or focused.
It can be controlled by a mouse/touch or a keyboard.

{{"demo": "pages/components/selects/UseSelect.js"}}
