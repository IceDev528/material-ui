# Date / Time pickers

<p class="description">Date pickers and Time pickers provide a simple way to select a single value from a pre-determined set.</p>

- On mobile, pickers are best suited for display in confirmation dialog.
- For inline display, such as on a form, consider using compact controls such as segmented dropdown buttons.
