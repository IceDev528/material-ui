# Layouts

<p class="description">A selection of basic layouts to help you get started building your app.</p>

They can be combined with one of the [examples](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/tree/master/examples) to form a complete starter.

Sections of each layout are clearly defined either by line-spacing, comments, or use of separate files, making it simple to extract parts of a page (such as a "hero unit", or footer, for example) for reuse in other pages.
