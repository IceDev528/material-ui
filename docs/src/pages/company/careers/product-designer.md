- Type of work: Full-time (contractor or employee [depending on the case](https://www.notion.so/mui-org/Hiring-FAQ-64763b756ae44c37b47b081f98915501))

## About us

See the [careers](/careers/), [handbook](https://mui-org.notion.site/Handbook-f086d47e10794d5e839aef9dc67f324b), and [about us](/about/) pages.

### Why we're hiring

Both our open-source community and our premium products are growing fast (x2-3 YoY).
We need talented people to keep that going!

So far we have relied a lot on the Material Design guidelines to implement amazing-looking components. However, we have reached the point where this is no longer sufficient.

We are aiming to make high-end design accessible to the many, empowering developers that lack access to a designer or dislike writing CSS.
We are looking for someone that can contribute to the following outcomes:

- Make the React component library the most visually appealing in the market.
- Strengthen the existing design team to support the growing number of developers working at MUI.
- Improve the product direction.

### Why this is interesting

The quality of design execution is [the leading reason why](/blog/2020-developer-survey-results/#6-what-are-your-key-criteria-when-choosing-a-ui-library) people pick MUI.
Providing functional components isn't enough, far from it.
We will empower developers & designers to build beautiful UIs üòç.

Our solution empowers React developers to build awesome applications ‚Äì hundreds of thousands of developers use MUI every month.

## About the role

### What you'll do on a day-to-day basis

Depending on the day, you'll:

- You will design new screens/components on Figma.
- You will write code with MUI.
- You will interview users to find out what they are using our existing products for and invent ways we can solve those problems even better than our users have imagined.
- You will contribute to the product direction. At MUI, the product is a lot driven by engineers and designers, especially on MUI Core.

### Here are a few initiatives you might work on

Projects you might have worked on if you were part of the team:

- [the new mui.com brand](https://www.figma.com/proto/4uv2dT18rXJPZBbrbpw61q/Marketing-site?node-id=4849%3A24442&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1)
- A redesign of the docs to isolate the products (`@mui/base`, `@mui/material`, `@mui/x`, etc.)

Tasks that you might work on once you join depending on how we organize the design team:

- Polish of all the content in the docs, e.g. customization demos.
- The product design on our work-in-progress low-code UI builder.
- The UX and visual design on our advanced components, like the data grid filtering or the date picker components.
- The update of the components to match the latest Material Design guidelines.
- The design and implementation of `@mui/material-next` to match [Material You](https://m3.material.io/).
- Design and implementation of new free templates, e.g. for refreshing Material Design or for second design system Joy.
- Design and implementation of new marketing pages, e.g. showcases and case studies.
- Take responsibility for the [MUI Design kits](https://mui.com/design-kits/) product while collaborating with the existing two designers working on it.

## About you

We're looking for someone with an expert eye for visual and UI design. You have enough development skills (CSS, React) to implement the designed interfaces. Details matter to you.

### Skills you should have

- **Expert-level knowledge of visual design**. You can create amazing-looking UIs. You care about every detail. You spot kerning issues, 1px misalignment even when not trying to pay attention.
- **Expert-level knowledge of UI design**. You can build intuitive UIs.
- **Enough development skills to implement the designed interfaces**. Our React engineers are often busy implementing complex components. We are looking for somebody with enough CSS and JSX skills to not depend on them to implement the design. It's also important for empathy with developers when contributing to the DX.
- **Strong written and verbal communication skills**. As part of the team, you'll interface both directly and indirectly with community members and enterprise customers, and contribute to user documentation. Clear communication is fundamental in creating intuitive and compelling resources.

### What would be nice if you had, but isn't required

- **You've contributed to a design system before**. You have worked on a library of components in the past, maybe for internal usage in your company.
- **You have other complementary skills**. We are a tiny team of 16 people. We could use any hidden skills that you might have. Maybe you are great at creating video animations or creating graphical illustrations.

## Compensation

Competitive compensation depending on the profile and location.
We are ready to pay top market rates for a person that can significantly push the mission forward.
