## About the company

MUI started with Material-UI, the most successful React implementation of Google's Material Design.
It has gained a large following, not only due to the fidelity to Material Design, but also because of the number of components, its carefully designed component API, obsession for details, and community engagement.
Today, countless teams and organizations rely on our open-source projects to build their design system.

A couple of years ago, we started to expand our suite of products.
We released [MUI X](/x/), a collection of advanced components; [MUI Design kits](/design-kits/), the MUI components available for the most popular design tools; and also host [Templates](/templates/), a set of pre-built UI kits.
We've seen rapid growth with all of them (2-3x per year) and we have more to come.

We are a fully distributed team, spread across multiple timezones.
We work mainly asynchronously, relying mostly on written collaboration.
Every contributor has the freedom to define how they work â€” the rest of us won't know what you're doing day-to-day unless you tell us.
For additional details about the MUI team and culture, you can check our [careers](/careers/) and [about](/about/) pages and also our [public Handbook](https://mui-org.notion.site/Handbook-f086d47e10794d5e839aef9dc67f324b).

## Why we're hiring

Both our open-source community and our premium products are growing fast (x2-3 YoY).
We need talented people to keep that going!

We need somebody to lead our HR strategy including hiring, onboarding, diversity & inclusion, learning & development, and employee happiness.
