<p class="description">You will define and maintain the product roadmap for the advanced components, identify opportunities, define specs, and work with engineers to execute on the features.

## Details of the Role

- Location: Remote (preference for UTC-6 to UTC+3).
- Type of work: Full-time (contractor or employee [depending on circumstances](https://mui-org.notion.site/Hiring-FAQ-64763b756ae44c37b47b081f98915501))
- Start date: Immediately.
- We're a remote company, we prefer asynchronous communication over meetings.
- We work independently, the rest of us won't know what you're doing day-to-day unless you tell us.

## About the company

MUI started with Material-UI, the most successful React implementation of Google's Material Design.
It has gained a large following, not only due to the fidelity to Material Design, but also because of the number of components, its carefully designed component API, obsession for details, and community engagement.
Today, countless teams and organizations rely on our open-source projects to build their design system.

A couple of years ago, we started to expand our suite of products.
We released [MUI X](/x/), a collection of advanced components; [MUI Design kits](/design-kits/), the MUI components available for the most popular design tools; and also host [Templates](/templates/), a set of pre-built UI kits.
We've seen rapid growth with all of them (2-3x per year) and we have more to come.

We are a fully distributed team, spread across multiple timezones.
We work mainly asynchronously, relying mostly on written collaboration.
Every contributor has the freedom to define how they work â€” the rest of us won't know what you're doing day-to-day unless you tell us.
For additional details about the MUI team and culture, you can check our [careers](/careers/) and [about](/about/) pages and also our [public Handbook](https://mui-org.notion.site/Handbook-f086d47e10794d5e839aef9dc67f324b).

## Why we're hiring

Both our open-source community and our premium products are growing fast (x2-3 YoY).
We need talented people to keep that going!

The advanced components team (X) needs help to build its best features.
We have started with the [data grid](/components/data-grid/) a year ago, but it's the beginning.
Our users are continuously providing feedback on the most important [pains they face](https://github.com/mui/mui-x/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc).

## About the role

### Why this is interesting

Our solution empowers React developers to build awesome applications â€“ hundreds of thousands of developers use MUI every month.
We are the second most used UI library in the world, after Bootstrap.

Our enterprise components portfolio is still small, with a million interesting and challenging problems to solve.

### What you'll do on a day-to-day basis

Depending on the day, you'll:

- You will coordinate with the engineering to ensure that the product being delivered at each iteration solves the problem.
  This involves growing a deep understanding of our technical choices and constraints.
- If time allows you to, you will assist the engineering team and implement some of the items in the backlog, up to part-time.
- You will drive the revenue and community growth by owning KPIs.
- You will grow and cultivate a deep understanding of the problems that developers have when they deal with enterprise applications. This means that you will observe and reach out to the community, run research interviews and share your insights with the team.
- You will keep a close eye on feature requests, issues, and general improvements (mostly through GitHub issues and occasionally Zendesk), to curate opportunities based on our strategy.
- You will build a strategy for your product area and contribute to the overall product strategy, e.g. establishing a go-to-market strategy.
- You will assess the impact of initiatives through telemetry data and qualitative feedback to help us develop our understanding further, and decide on the next steps.
