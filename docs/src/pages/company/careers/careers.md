# Careers at Material-UI

<p class="description">We build the next generation of tools for UI development. Material-UI is focused on making React UI development faster, simpler, and accessible to more people.</p>

The open-source project started back in 2014 to unify React and Material Design. Today, Material-UI has grown to become one of the world's most popular React UI libraries, backed by a vibrant community of more than 2M developers in over 180 countries.

The company is bootstrapped (so far).
It was incorporated in mid-2019 and yet growing fast (x2-3 YoY).
We doubled the team in 2020 and are on track to do the same in 2021.
