# Drawer

The [Drawer](https://material.io/guidelines/patterns/navigation-drawer.html) slides in from the side. It is a common pattern found in Google apps and follows the keylines and metrics for lists.

There are no examples for uncontrolled mode because an uncontrolled `Drawer` can only be opened with a swipe. The doc site has an uncontrolled `Drawer`. Swipe from the left on a touch device to see it.

## Undocked example

An undocked controlled `Drawer` with custom width. The Drawer can be cancelled by clicking the overlay or pressing the Esc key. It closes when an item is selected, handled by controlling the `open` prop.
