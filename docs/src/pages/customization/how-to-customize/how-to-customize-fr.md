# Personnaliser les composants

<p class="description">Vous pouvez facilement personnaliser l'apparence d'un composant Material-UI.</p>

As components can be used in different contexts, there are several approaches to customizing them. Du plus étroit cas d'utilisation au plus large, il s'agit des suivants :

1. [One-off customization](#1-one-off-customization)
1. [Reusable style overrides](#2-reusable-style-overrides)
1. [Dynamic variation](#3-dynamic-variation)
1. [Variation globale du thème](#4-global-theme-variation)

## 1. One-off customization

Vous devrez peut-être modifier le style d'un composant pour un cas particulier. Vous disposez des solutions suivantes :

### Use the `sx` prop

The easiest way to add style overrides for a one-off situation is to use the `sx` prop available on all Material-UI components. Here is an example:

{{"demo": "pages/customization/how-to-customize/SxProp.js"}}

Next you'll see how you can you can use global class selectors for accessing slots inside the component. You'll also learn how to easily identify the classes which are available to you for each of the states and slots in the component.

### Overriding nested component styles

You can use the browser dev tools to identify the slot for the component you want to override. It can save you a lot of time. The styles injected into the DOM by Material-UI rely on class names that [follow a simple pattern](/styles/advanced/#class-names): `[hash]-Mui[Component name]-[name of the slot]`.

⚠️ These class names can't be used as CSS selectors because they are unstable, however, Material-UI applies global class names using a consistent convention: `Mui[Component name]-[name of the slot]`.

Let's go back to the above demo. How can you override the slider's thumb?

<img src="/static/images/customization/dev-tools.png" alt="dev-tools" width="406" />

In this example, the styles are applied with `.css-ae2u5c-MuiSlider-thumb` so the name of the component is `Slider` and the name of the slot is `thumb`.

You now know that you need to target the `.MuiSlider-thumb` class name for overriding the look of the thumb:

{{"demo": "pages/customization/how-to-customize/DevTools.js"}}

### Remplacement de styles avec des noms de classe

If you would like to override the styles of the components using classes, you can use the `className` prop available on each component. For overriding the styles of the different parts inside the component, you can use the global classes available for each slot, as described in the previous section.

You can find examples of this using different styles libraries in the [Styles library interoperability](/guides/interoperability/) guide.

### Pseudo-classes

The components special states, like *hover*, *focus*, *disabled* and *selected*, are styled with a higher CSS specificity. [Specificity is a weight](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity) that is applied to a given CSS declaration.

In order to override the components special states, **you need to increase specificity**. Here is an example with the *disable* state and the button component using a **pseudo-class** (`:disabled`):

```css
.Button {
  color: black;
}

/* Increase the specificity */
.Button:disabled {
  color: white;
}
```

```jsx
<Button disabled className="Button">
```

Sometimes, you can't use a **pseudo-class**, as the state doesn't exist in the web specification. Let's take the menu item component and the *selected* state as an example. You can use the `.Mui-selected` global class name to customize the special state of the `MenuItem` component:

```css
.MenuItem {
  color: black;
}

/* Increase the specificity */
.MenuItem.Mui-selected {
  color: blue;
}
```

```jsx
<MenuItem selected className="MenuItem">
```

#### Why do I need to increase specificity to override one component state?

By design, the CSS specification makes the pseudo-classes increase the specificity. For consistency with native elements, Material-UI increases the specificity of its custom pseudo-classes. This has one important advantage, it allows you to cherry-pick the state you want to customize.

#### What custom pseudo-classes are available in Material-UI?

You can rely on the following [global class names](/styles/advanced/#with-material-ui-core) generated by Material-UI:

| State         | Global class name   |
|:------------- |:------------------- |
| checked       | `.Mui-checked`      |
| disabled      | `.Mui-disabled`     |
| error         | `.Mui-error`        |
| focused       | `.Mui-focused`      |
| focus visible | `.Mui-focusVisible` |
| required      | `.Mui-required`     |
| expanded      | `.Mui-expanded`     |
| selected      | `.Mui-selected`     |

> ⚠️ Never style these pseudo-class class names directly:

```css
/* ❌ NOT OK, impact all the components with unclear side-effects */
.Mui-error {
  color: red;
}

/* ✅ OK */
.MuiOutinedInput-root.Mui-error {
  color: red;
}
```

## 2. Reusable style overrides

If you find that you need the same overrides in multiple places across your application, you can use the `experimentalStyled()` utility for creating a reusable component:

{{"demo": "pages/customization/how-to-customize/StyledCustomization.js", "defaultCodeOpen": true}}

With it, you have access to all of a component's props to dynamically style the component.

## 3. Dynamic variation

In the previous section, we learned how to override the style of a Material-UI component. Now, let's see how we can make these overrides dynamic. Here are four alternatives; each has its pros and cons.

### Dynamic CSS

{{"demo": "pages/customization/how-to-customize/DynamicCSS.js", "defaultCodeOpen": false}}

### Class name branch

{{"demo": "pages/customization/how-to-customize/DynamicClassName.js"}}

### CSS variables

{{"demo": "pages/customization/how-to-customize/DynamicCSSVariables.js"}}

### Theme nesting

{{"demo": "pages/customization/how-to-customize/DynamicThemeNesting.js"}}

## 4. Variation globale du thème

In order to promote consistency between components, and manage the user interface appearance as a whole, Material-UI provides a mechanism to apply global changes.

Please take a look at the theme's [global overrides page](/customization/theme-components/) for more details.
