# CSS in JS

Material-UI aims to provide strong foundations for building dynamic UIs.
For the sake of simplicity **we expose our internal styling solution to users**.
You can use it, but you don't have to. This styling solution is interoperable with other solutions like [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss), [CSS modules](https://github.com/css-modules), or [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components).

## Our styling solution

In the previous versions, Material-UI was using LESS, then a custom inline-style solution to write the style of the components.
These approaches have proven to be limited.
Finally, we have [moved toward](https://github.com/oliviertassinari/a-journey-toward-better-style) a *CSS-in-JS* solution. It's **unlocking many great features** (theme nesting, dynamic styles, self-support, etc.).
We think that it's the future:
- [A Unified Styling Language](https://medium.com/seek-blog/a-unified-styling-language-d0c208de2660)
- [The future of component-based styling](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/css-in-javascript-the-future-of-component-based-styling-70b161a79a32)

So, you may have noticed in the demos how this *CSS-in-JS* looks.
We use the `withStyles` Higher-order Component. Here's an example:

{{demo='pages/customization/CssInJs.js'}}

## JSS

The styling solution of Material-UI is using [JSS](https://github.com/cssinjs/jss) at its core.
It's a [high performance](https://github.com/cssinjs/jss/blob/master/docs/performance.md) JS to CSS compiler which works at runtime and server-side.
It is about 5KB (minified and gzipped) and is extensible via a [plugins](https://github.com/cssinjs/jss/blob/master/docs/plugins.md) API.

If you end up using this styling solution in your codebase, you're going to need to *learn the API*.
The best place to start is by looking at the features each [plugin](http://cssinjs.org/plugins) is providing. Material-UI is using the [`jss-preset-default`](http://cssinjs.org/jss-preset-default) module. You can always add new plugins if needed with the [`JssProvider` helper](https://github.com/cssinjs/react-jss#custom-setup).

## Sheets registry

When rendering on the server, you will need to get all rendered styles as a CSS string.
`SheetsRegistry` class allows you to manually aggregate and stringify them.
Read more about [Server Rendering here](/guides/server-rendering).

{{demo='pages/customization/JssRegistry.js'}}

## Sheets manager

We use a [reference counting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_counting) algorithm in order to attach and detach the style sheets only once per (styles, theme) couple.
This technique provides an important performance boost when rerending instances of a component.

When only rendering on the client, that's not something you need to be aware of. However, when rendering on the server you do. You can read more about [Server Rendering here](/guides/server-rendering).

## Class names

You may have noticed, the class names generated by our styling solution are **non-deterministic**.
You can't rely on them. The following CSS won't work:
```css
.MuiAppBar-root-12 {
  opacity: 0.6
}
```

Instead, you have to use the `classes` property.
On the other hand, thanks to the non-deterministic nature of our class names, we
can implement optimization for development and production.
They are easy to debug in development and as short as possible in production:

- development: `.MuiAppBar-root-12`
- production: `.c12`

## API

### `withStyles(styles, [options]) => Higher-order Component`

Link a style sheet with a component.
It does not modify the component passed to it; instead, it returns a new component, with a `classes` property.
This `classes` object contains the name of the class names injected in the DOM.

Some implementation details that might be interesting to being aware of:
- It's adding a `classes` property so you can override the injected class names from the outside.
- It's adding a `innerRef` property so you can get a reference to the wrapped component.
- It's forwarding *non react static* properties so this HOC is more "transparent".
For instance, it can be used to defined a `getInitialProps()` static method (next.js).

#### Arguments

1. `styles` (*Function | Object*): A function generating the styles or an object.
It will be linked to the component.
Use the function signature if you need to have access to the theme. It's provided as the first argument.
2. `options` (*Object* [optional]):
  - `options.withTheme` (Boolean [optional]): Provide the `theme` object to the component as a property. It's `false` by default.
  - `options.name` (*String* [optional]): The name of the style sheet. Useful for debugging.
  If the value isn't provided, we will try to fallback to the name of the component.
  - The other keys are forwarded to the options argument of [jss.createStyleSheet()](http://cssinjs.org/js-api/#create-style-sheet).

#### Returns

`Higher-order Component`: Should be used to wrap a component.

#### Examples

```js
import { withStyles } from 'material-ui/styles';

const styles = {
  root: {
    background: 'red',
  },
};

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  render () {
    return <div className={this.props.classes.root} />;
  }
}

export default withStyles(styles)(MyComponent);
```

Also, you can use as [decorators](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-decorators/) like so:

```js
import { withStyles } from 'material-ui/styles';

const styles = {
  root: {
    background: 'red',
  },
};

@withStyles(styles)
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  render () {
    return <div className={this.props.classes.root} />;
  }
}

export default MyComponent
```
