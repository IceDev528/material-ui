# Default Theme

The theme normalizes implementation by providing default values for palette, dark and light types, typography, breakpoints, shadows, transitions, etc.

If you want to learn more about how the theme is assembled, take a look at [`material-ui/style/createMuiTheme.js`](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/blob/v1-beta/src/styles/createMuiTheme.js),
and the related imports which `createMuiTheme` uses.

Here's what the theme object looks like with the default values:

{{"demo": "pages/customization/ThemeDefault.js", "hideEditButton": true}}
