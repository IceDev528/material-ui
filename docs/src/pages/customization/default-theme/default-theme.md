## Explore

Explore the documentation theme object:

{{"demo": "pages/customization/default-theme/DefaultTheme.js", "hideHeader": true}}

> Tip: you can play with the documentation theme object in **your console**,
as the `theme` variable is exposed on all the documentation pages.
Please note that the documentation site is using a custom theme.

If you want to learn more about how the theme is assembled, take a look at [`material-ui/style/createMuiTheme.js`](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/blob/master/packages/material-ui/src/styles/createMuiTheme.js),
and the related imports which `createMuiTheme` uses.
