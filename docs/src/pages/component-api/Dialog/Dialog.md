## Classes

You can overrides all the class names injected by Material-UI thanks to the `classes` property.
This property accepts the following keys:
- `modal`
- `dialog`
- `dialogWidth-xs`
- `dialogWidth-sm`
- `dialogWidth-md`
- `fullScreen`

Have a look at [overriding with class names](/customization/overrides#overriding-with-class-names)
section for more detail.

If using the `overrides` key of the theme as documented
[here](/customization/themes#customizing-all-instances-of-a-component-type),
you need to use the following style sheet name: `MuiDialog`.
