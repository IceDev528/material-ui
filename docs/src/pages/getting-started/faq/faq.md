## How to fix a class names conflict in production?

This is probably the nÂ°1 issue people are facing starting with Material-UI.
The class names value relies on the concept of [class name generator](/customization/css-in-js#creategenerateclassname-options-class-name-generator).
The whole page needs to be rendered with **one generator**.
You might end up using two class name generators in a variety of contexts:
- You **bundle** two versions of Material-UI. You might have a dependency not correctly setting Material-UI as a peer dependency.
Each version of Material-UI uses its own default class name generator.
- You are using `JssProvider` for a **subset** of your React Tree.
Material-UI has a default class name generator, `JssProvider` is providing a second one.

It's simple to recover from this problem. Use the [`JssProvider`](/customization/css-in-js#jssprovider) component at the top of your React tree to inject a single class name generator.

## Why do the fixed positioned elements move when a modal is opened?

We block the scroll as soon as a modal is opened.
This prevents interacting with the background when the modal should be the only interactive content, however, removing the scrollbar can make your **fixed positioned elements** move.
In this situation, you can apply a global `.mui-fixed` class name to tell Material-UI to handle those elements.

## How can I disable the ripple effect on the whole app?

The best solution at present is to write wrapping components for all the Material-UI components showing a ripple.
The ripple effect is exclusively coming from the `BaseButton` component.
You can find the components using the ButtonBase [here](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=%22%2F%2F+%40inheritedComponent+ButtonBase%22).
Then, all you have to do is to provide the `disableRipple` property.

## Do I have to use JSS to style my app?

It's highly recommended:

- It comes built in, so carries no additional bundle size overhead.
- It's fast & memory efficient.
- It has a clean, consistent [API](http://cssinjs.org/json-api/).
- It supports a number of advanced features, either natively, or through [plugins](http://cssinjs.org/plugins/).

However perhaps you're adding some Material-UI components to an app that already uses another styling solution,
or are already familiar with a different API, and don't want to learn a new one? In that case, head over to the
[Style Library Interoperability](/guides/interoperability) section,
where we show how simple it is to restyle Material-UI components with alternative style libraries.

## When should I use inline-style vs classes?

As a rule of thumb, only use inline-style for dynamic style properties. The CSS alternative provides more advantages, such as:

- auto-prefixing
- better debugging
- media queries
- keyframes

## How do I use react-router?

We have documented how to use a [third-party routing library](/demos/buttons#third-party-routing-library) with the `ButtonBase` component.
A lot of our interactive components use it internally:
`Button`, `MenuItem`, `<ListItem button />`, `Tab`, etc.
You can use the same solution with them.

## How do I combine the `withStyles()` and `withTheme()` HOCs?

There are a number of different options:

### `withTheme` option:

```js
export default withStyles(styles, { withTheme: true })(Modal);
```

### `compose()` helper function:

```js
import { compose } from 'recompose';

export default compose(
  withTheme(),
  withStyles(styles)
)(Modal);
```

### raw function chaining:

```js
export default withTheme()(withStyles(styles)(Modal));
```

## How can I access the DOM element?

Wrap the component with the [`<RootRef>`](/api/root-ref) helper.

## Why are the colors I am seeing different from what I see here?

The documentation site is using a custom theme. Hence, the color palette is
different from the default theme that Material-UI ships. Please refer to [this
page](/customization/themes) to learn about theme customization.

## Material-UI is awesome. How can I support the project?

There are many ways to support Material-UI:
- Improve [the documentation](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/tree/master/docs).
- Help others to get started.
- [Spread the word](https://twitter.com/MaterialUI).
- Answer [StackOverflow questions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/material-ui) or [issues marked as question](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aquestion) in the repository.

If you use Material-UI in a commercial project and would like to support its continued development by becoming a **Sponsor**,
or in a side or hobby project and would like to become a backer, you can do so through [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/material-ui).

All funds raised are managed transparently, and Sponsors receive recognition in the README and on the Material-UI home page.
