# Examples

Are you looking for an example project to get started?

We host some example projects. You can find them in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui) under the [`/examples`](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/tree/v1-beta/examples) folder:
- [Create React App](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/tree/v1-beta/examples/create-react-app)
- [Next.js](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/tree/v1-beta/examples/nextjs)

The source code for this documentation site is also included in the repository.
This is a slightly more complex project.
Check out the [`/docs`](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/tree/v1-beta/docs) folder for
build instructions.
