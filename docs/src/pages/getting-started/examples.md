# Examples

There are 2 projects that you can look at to get started.
These projects are basic examples that show how to consume Material-UI components in your own project.
- The [first project](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui-webpack-example) uses [webpack](http://webpack.github.io) for module bundling and building.
- While the [second project](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui-browserify-gulp-example) uses [browserify](http://browserify.org/) for module bundling and
[gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) for JS task automation.

The source code for this documentation site is also included in the repository.
This is a slightly more complex project that also uses webpack, and contains
examples of every material-ui component.
Check out the [docs folder](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/tree/master/docs) for
build instructions.
