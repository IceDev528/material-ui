# Migration from v0.x

## FAQ

### Woah - the API is way different! Does that mean 1.0 is completely different, Iâ€™ll have to learn the basics all over again, and migrating will be practically impossible?

Iâ€™m glad you asked! The answer is no. The core concepts havenâ€™t changed.
You will notice that the API provides more flexibility, but this has a cost.
We have been making lower-level components, abstracting less complexity.

### What motivated such large change?

Material-UI was started [3 years ago](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/commit/28b768913b75752ecf9b6bb32766e27c241dbc46).
The ecosystem has evolved a lot since then, we have also learned a lot.
[@nathanmarks](https://github.com/nathanmarks/) started an ambitious task, rebuilding Material-UI from the **ground-up**
taking advantage of this knowledge to address long-standing issues. To name some of the major changes:
- New styling solution using CSS-in-JS (better [customization](/customization/overrides) power, better performance)
- New [theme handling](/customization/themes) (nesting, self-supporting, etc.)
- Blazing fast documentation thanks to [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js)
- Way better [test coverage](/guides/testing) (99%+, run on all the major browsers, [visual regression tests](https://www.argos-ci.com/callemall/material-ui))
- Full [server-side rendering](/guides/server-rendering) support
- Wide range of [supported browsers](/getting-started/supported-platforms)

### Where should I start in a migration?

1. Start by installing the v1.x version of Material-UI along side the v0.x version.
[Yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn) provides an alias feature to do so:
```sh
yarn add material-ui@latest
yarn add material-ui-next@npm:material-ui@next
```
then
```js
import FlatButton from 'material-ui/FlatButton'; // v0.x
import Button from 'material-ui-next/Button'; // v1.x
```
2. Run [the migration helper](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/tree/v1-beta/packages/material-ui-codemod) on your project.
3. After that, you are free to migrate one component instance at the time.

## Components

### Flat Button

```diff
-import FlatButton from 'material-ui/FlatButton';
+import Button from 'material-ui-next/Button';

-<FlatButton />
+<Button />
```

### Raised Button

```diff
-import RaisedButton from 'material-ui/RaisedButton';
+import Button from 'material-ui-next/Button';

-<RaisedButton />
+<Button raised />
```
