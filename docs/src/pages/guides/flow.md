# Flow

You can add static typing to JavaScript to improve developer productivity and code quality thanks to [Flow](https://github.com/facebook/flow).
Have a look at the [Create React App with Flow](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/tree/v1-beta/examples/create-react-app-with-flow) example.

## Warning 
An [existing bug in flow regarding the use of higher order components (HOC)](https://github.com/facebook/flow/issues/5382) 
limits the usefulness of flow by an application.  As of November 27, 2017 we cannot recommend the use of flow 
typing in your application in conjunction with `material-ui`.  

This issue is under discussion in [#9312](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/issues/9312).
