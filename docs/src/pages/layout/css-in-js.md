# CSS in JS

Sometimes, wrapping things inside a layout component doesn't make much sense when
everything you need can be handled by a small CSS change. By using the
`breakpoints` attribute of the theme, you can utilise the same breakpoints used
for the [Grid](/layout/grid) and [Hidden](/layout/hidden) components directly in your component.

This can be accomplished using [CSS-in-JS](/customization/css-in-js).
