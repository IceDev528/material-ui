# Responsive UI

[Responsive layouts](https://material.io/guidelines/layout/responsive-ui.html) in material design adapt to any possible screen size.

## Breakpoints

For optimal user experience, material design interfaces need to be able to adapt their layout at various breakpoints.  
Material UI uses a **simplified** implementation of the orignal [specification](https://material.io/guidelines/layout/responsive-ui.html#responsive-ui-breakpoints).

Each breakpoint matches with a *fixed* screen width:
- **xs**, extra-small: 360dp
- **sm**, small: 600dp
- **md**, medium: 960dp
- **lg**, large: 1280dp
- **xl**, xlarge: 1920dp
