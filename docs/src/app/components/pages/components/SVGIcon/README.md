## SVG Icons
Using material-ui's SVG Icon, we can create a custom [svg component](https://www.google.com/design/spec/style/icons.html#icons-system-icons). In our examples, we are creating the ActionHome SvgIcon for this docs site, and using it in some separate component.
Custom SvgIcon components can be included as children for other Material UI components that use icons such as [IconButtons](http://www.material-ui.com/#/components/icon-button).

To see available Material Icons, go to [material icons library](https://design.google.com/icons/).
All those icons are available in the [svg-icons](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/tree/master/src/svg-icons) folder.
For instance to use the `home` icon you need to import `material-ui/lib/svg-icons/action/home`
