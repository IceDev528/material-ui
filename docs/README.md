Demo project for material-ui-picker

First of all want to thanks for taking your time to contribute ðŸŽ‰
There is a little instruction of how to run the demo locally using `npm link`

Just run this command from root and you will be able to run demo.

```sh
npm link && cd docs && npm link material-ui-pickers
```

Thats it, your local build is linked to demo project!
Please note that you need to start the project in both `root` and `/docs folders`, fist will build cjs module for you, and demo would be automaticly reloaded by watcher.
