| keyboardFocusedClassName | string |  | The CSS class applied while the component is keyboard focused. |
| onKeyboardFocus | signature |  | Callback fired when the component is focused with a keyboard. We trigger a `onFocus` callback too. |

## CSS API

You can override all the class names injected by Material-UI thanks to the `classes` property.
This property accepts the following keys:
- `root`
- `disabled`

Have a look at [overriding with classes](/customization/overrides#overriding-with-classes)
section for more detail.

If using the `overrides` key of the theme as documented
[here](/customization/themes#customizing-all-instances-of-a-component-type),
you need to use the following style sheet name: `MuiButtonBase`.
