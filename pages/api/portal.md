# Portal

This component shares many concepts with
[react-overlays](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/react-overlays/#portals)
But has been fork in order to fix some bugs, reduce the number of dependencies
and take the control of our destiny.

## Props

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| <span style="color: #31a148">childrenâ€‰*</span> | node |  | The children to render into the `container`. |
| container | union:&nbsp;object&nbsp;&#124;<br>&nbsp;func<br> |  | A node, component instance, or function that returns either. The `container` will have the portal children appended to it. |
| onRendered | func |  | Callback fired once the children has been mounted into the `container`. |

Any other properties supplied will be [spread to the root element](/guides/api#spread).
