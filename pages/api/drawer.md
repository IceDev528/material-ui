## CSS API

You can overrides all the class names injected by Material-UI thanks to the `classes` property.
This property accepts the following keys:
- `paper`
- `anchorLeft`
- `anchorRight`
- `anchorTop`
- `anchorBottom`
- `docked`
- `modal`

Have a look at [overriding with classes](/customization/overrides#overriding-with-classes)
section for more detail.

If using the `overrides` key of the theme as documented
[here](/customization/themes#customizing-all-instances-of-a-component-type),
you need to use the following style sheet name: `MuiDrawer`.
