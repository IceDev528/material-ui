# Chip

Chips represent complex entities in small blocks, such as a contact.

## Props

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| avatar | Element |  | Avatar element. |
| classes | Object |  | Useful to extend the style applied to components. |
| deleteIcon | Element |  | Custom delete icon. Will be shown only if `onRequestDelete` is set. |
| label | Node |  | The content of the label. |
| onRequestDelete | signature |  | Callback function fired when the delete icon is clicked. If set, the delete icon will be shown. |

Any other properties supplied will be [spread to the root element](/customization/api#spread).

## CSS API

You can override all the class names injected by Material-UI thanks to the `classes` property.
This property accepts the following keys:
- `root`
- `clickable`
- `deletable`
- `avatar`
- `avatarChildren`
- `label`
- `deleteIcon`

Have a look at [overriding with classes](/customization/overrides#overriding-with-classes) section
and the [implementation of the component](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/tree/v1-beta/src/Chip/Chip.js)
for more detail.

If using the `overrides` key of the theme as documented
[here](/customization/themes#customizing-all-instances-of-a-component-type),
you need to use the following style sheet name: `MuiChip`.
