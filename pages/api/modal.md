# Modal

The modal component provides a solid foundation for creating dialogs,
popovers, or whatever else.
The component renders its `children` node in front of a backdrop component.

The `Modal` offers a few helpful features over using just a `Portal` component and some styles:
- Manages dialog stacking when one-at-a-time just isn't enough.
- Creates a backdrop, for disabling interaction below the modal.
- It properly manages focus; moving to the modal content,
  and keeping it there until the modal is closed.
- It disables scrolling of the page content while open.
- Adds the appropriate ARIA roles are automatically.

This component shares many concepts with [react-overlays](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/react-overlays/#modals).

## CSS API

You can override all the class names injected by Material-UI thanks to the `classes` property.
This property accepts the following keys:
- `root`
- `hidden`

Have a look at [overriding with classes](/customization/overrides#overriding-with-classes) section
and the [implementation of the component](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/tree/v1-beta/src/Modal/Modal.js)
for more detail.

If using the `overrides` key of the theme as documented
[here](/customization/themes#customizing-all-instances-of-a-component-type),
you need to use the following style sheet name: `MuiModal`.
