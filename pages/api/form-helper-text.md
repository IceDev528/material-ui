# FormHelperText



## Props
| Name | Type | Default | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| children | Node |  | The content of the component. |
| classes | Object |  | Useful to extend the style applied to components. |
| disabled | boolean |  | If `true`, the helper text should be displayed in a disabled state. |
| error | boolean |  | If `true`, helper text should be displayed in an error state. |
| margin | literal |  | If `dense`, will adjust vertical spacing. This is normally obtained via context from FormControl. |

Any other properties supplied will be [spread to the root element](/customization/api#spread).

## CSS API

You can override all the class names injected by Material-UI thanks to the `classes` property.
This property accepts the following keys:
- `root`
- `dense`
- `error`
- `disabled`

Have a look at [overriding with classes](/customization/overrides#overriding-with-classes)
section for more detail.

If using the `overrides` key of the theme as documented
[here](/customization/themes#customizing-all-instances-of-a-component-type),
you need to use the following style sheet name: `MuiFormHelperText`.
