# Material-UI Scripts

## Release

A typical release goes like this:

1. **Changelog**. Generate the changelog:

  - Compare the last version with `next`. For instance: https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/compare/v5.0.0-alpha.17...next
  - Generate the changelog with this script: https://trello.com/c/uspnIWkh/1566-release-note
  - Clean the generated changelog, to match the format of https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/releases.
  - Open a pull request with the generated change on `next`.

1. **build**. Prepare the release:

  ```
  git checkout next
  git pull
  yarn
  yarn release:version
  yarn release:build
  ```

1. **version**. Update the `/package.json` version and commit all the changes

  ```
  git commit -am "v5.0.0-alpha.18"
  git tag v5.0.0-alpha.18
  ```

1. **npm**. Release the packages to npm. You need your 2FA device:

  ```
  yarn release:publish
  ```

1. **git**. Push the release git commit and git tag to master (e.g. "v5.0.0-alpha.17"):

  ```
  git push
  git push --tag
  ```

1. **Docs**. Push the next branch on the release branch to deploy the documentation with the latest changes. It lives at https://material-ui.netlify.app/. Force push if necessary.

  ```
  yarn docs:deploy
  ```
1. **GitHub**.  Make a new release on GitHub (for people subscribing to updates). https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/releases
1. **Twitter**. Make sure Material-UI X was released at the same time: https://trello.com/c/kYF9OLLi/105-release-steps. Send a tweet with the main Twitter account to summarize what happened.
