## Passing date adapter down to pickers

There are a couple of ways to pass date-io adapter to pickers components.

#### Context vs dateAdapter prop

Recomended way to pass date adapter is using our `LocalizationProvider` and pass it through the context.
Also there is a `dateAdapter` prop available, it allows to get rid of additional context.

But you need to understand a few things:

- `dateAdapter` will create a new context instance inside the date-picker, it may impact rendering performance if you have a lot of pickers on the screen
- You must make sure your adapter is properly memoized before passing it down
  (if not â€“ all components tree inside any picker will always rerender on your component change)
